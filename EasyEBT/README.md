# Easy EBT
## Description
EasyEBT is a website that allows users to find EBT supporting stores near them. 
Once they choose a store, the user will be shown all the EBT eligible items that store provides and can make grocery lists. 
The grocery list sums up the total price of the items and takes your EBT cash into account to calculate a new total.
Once the user has created a grocery list they have the option to toggle to the recipes page which generates recipes based on the grocery list allowing users to easily plan meals
